# Registration

In this repo Members can register to be a member of the Single Pool Alliance.

By submitting a pull request you agree that all the submited information will be publicly available to everyone.

Also, by submitting you agree that you will fight for the full decentralization of Cardano by only running a single pool and reporting members that are breaking the rules by running multiple pools.

Simply create a pull request with the information of your pool in the registry.json file
